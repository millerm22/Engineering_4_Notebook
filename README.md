# Engineering_4_Notebook
This repository will actually serve as a aid to help you get started with your own template.  You should copy the raw form of this readme into your own, and use this template to write your own.

I didn't ask you to document hello_world.py or dice_roller.py, so we will start with calculator.py.

## Basics
You can delete this section from your own personal readme. 

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. It should be a few sentences.

### Evidence 

Pictures / Gifs of your work should go here.  You need to communicate what your thing does. For code only assignments like the Python calculator, include a screenshot of the output of the code.

### Wiring

This may not be applicable to all assignments. Anything where you wire something up, include the wiring diagram here.

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience?  Your ultimate goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Thins about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" when you realize you need some of this code in three months, me, or your college admission committee!

** Don't forget to COMMENT YOUR CODE in github!**

```


### Evidence
Pictures / Gifs of your work should go here.  You need to communicate what your thing does.

### Wiring
Make an account with your google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
